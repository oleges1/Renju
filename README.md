# Renju

Educational ML project.

In the end we are going to prepare algorithm good in playing Renju - game, which is similar to Go, but a bit easier.


## Labs:
 1) Linear models and gradient descent
 2) Multilayer perceptron and autoencoders
 3) Chinese characters
 4) Reinforcement learning and tic-tac-toe game with RL

Also in folder RENJU you can find a main part of project - agent for playing Renju.
