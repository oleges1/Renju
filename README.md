# Renju

Educational ML project.

In the end we are going to prepare algorithm good in playing Renju (Gomoku) - tic-tac-toe, but on 15 * 15, five in line.

Prepared agent can be found at the folder RENJU.

### Labs:
 1) Linear models and gradient descent
 2) Multilayer perceptron and autoencoders
 3) Chinese characters
 4) Reinforcement learning and tic-tac-toe game with RL

### Special thanks to our mentor - [Denis Simagin]
